# TL;DR

After successfully integrating AWS and Salesforce in a small-scale trial, the results of our proof of concept (POC) showed that we could completely remove webchat wrap notes. This would lead to an annual cost saving of £200k.

# Business Context

As Net Zero streams such as heat pumps, EVs, PHJones, and HIVE become more popular in line with Government policies on cleaner energy, Centrica Net Zero anticipates a substantial increase in contact demand in the upcoming months and years. Therefore, a strategy is being developed to handle this surge in contact demand, especially in light of increasing operating expense costs.

# Business Problem

The wider Net Zero Contact Strategy aims to manage balance sheets and achieve cost savings. In this context, can the data science team assist in reducing contact operating expenses (OPEX)?

# Definition

Wrap - Wrap is the timeframe after a call or webhat conversation that the agent summarises or notes the purpose and any key details in the call for future reference.



# Association rule mining

Providing customers with a spare replacement hub adaptor for every purchase costs less than the combined cost of customers calling to order a replacement and filing a complaint for a broken adaptor. This is because the cost of these customer service interactions is higher than the unit cost of the product.

**Mediation analysis** is a statistical tool that can be use to find out that 
the reason why people are less likely to buy drugs with complex name is because 
they percieved the drugs as more dangerous. While there are several ways to
conduct mediation analysis, the `JSmediation` package implements the best one
of them[^3]: joint-significance.

Have a look at [the documentation](https://jsmediation.cedricbatailler.me/) and 
give it a shot!
