# First Principles Thinking

- Our stakeholder approaches us with the problem 'Are breakdowns predictable?'

The short answer, if I was a betting man, would be 'I think so'. Perhaps another answer could involve
answering the questions with a series of questions:

1) Why are you asking?
2) What problem are you trying to solve?
3) Is it a problem worth solving?
4) Do we collect the data --- data collection is huge here!!

# Is this a problem? Is it worth solving?

> Using IoT and data analytics to predict and prevent breakdowns can reduce overall downtime by 50%. (McKinsey)
