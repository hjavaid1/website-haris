# TL;DR

TL;DR - 


## AFT and Cox-Propotional Hazard (CPH) ... survival analysis using SPARK

# Managing the stakeholder

- Our stakeholder approaches us with the problem 'Are breakdowns predictable?'

Upon initial review of the issue, two potential solutions presented themselves: utilizing historical time-series data to forecast equipment breakdowns or implementing a time-to-failure algorithm. However, prior to pursuing these technical approaches, it is crucial to gain a thorough understanding of the business problem being addressed. 

This includes conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine the potential impact of a solution and to weigh the resources required against the value they will bring to the organization. By taking a strategic and data-driven approach, we can ensure that any solution we implement aligns with our overall business goals and delivers a meaningful return on investment.

## First Principles Thinking



The short answer, if I was a betting man, would be 'I think so'. Perhaps another answer could involve
answering the questions with a series of questions:

1) Why are you asking?
2) What problem are you trying to solve?
3) Is it a problem worth solving?
4) Do we collect the data --- data collection is huge here!!

## Is this a problem? Is it worth solving?

## Literature review

Predictive maintenance is a critical aspect of modern businesses, aimed at proactively identifying potential failures in complex systems and reducing downtime, thus providing a competitive edge. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, predictive maintenance enables organizations to make informed decisions about maintenance operations, minimize unplanned downtime, and optimize resource utilization.

As highlighted by M.M. de Oliveira et al. in their paper "A Machine Learning-Based Predictive Maintenance Framework for Industrial Plants," "predictive maintenance helps organizations to reduce the risk of unexpected breakdowns, improve the availability and performance of critical assets, and lower maintenance costs." This leads to increased customer satisfaction, improved operational efficiency, and a reduction in overall maintenance costs, making predictive maintenance a key component of a successful business strategy.

Predictive maintenance begins with the installation of sensors on systems, which continuously collect operational data, typically in the form of time series data, including timestamps, sensor readings, and device identifiers. This data is analyzed using machine learning algorithms, with the goal of predicting equipment failures and determining the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the equipment. Predictive maintenance can be implemented using either a classification or regression approach.

The classification approach, as outlined by J. Kim et al. in their paper "Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks," predicts the likelihood of failure in the next n-steps, providing a binary answer to the possibility of failure. The regression approach, as described by Y. Jiang et al. in their paper "Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Assets Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks," predicts the RUL, providing a more precise estimate of the time before the next failure.

As stated by S. Aswathy et al. in their paper "Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment: A Review of Machine Learning Approaches," "predictive maintenance is an essential aspect of modern businesses, providing organizations with a competitive edge by enabling proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and maximizing resource utilization." By harnessing the power of data science and machine learning, predictive maintenance provides organizations with the tools they need to make informed decisions, reduce costs, and improve the performance and availability of their critical assets.
