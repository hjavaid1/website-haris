### TL;DR

This project was an engagement between Centrica and NEAS Energy (based in Denmark). The high-level solution was an R package containing a model that detected anomalies in current fuel levels, applied SVM filters to clean data and a prediction model that would predict future fuel levels

### Defining the problem



**How is the problem allowed to happen?'**

A vast number of our calls do not contain NLCS (natural language call steering) tags and even more contain the tag 'NONE COLLECTED' suggesting either the customer was silent or the speech recognition was not upto task.


**How is something allowed to persist?'**

Questions also remain regarding 

It is imperative that we adopt a scientific and data-driven approach to comprehensively understand our current situation.

Lacking a comprehensive system for tracking and monitoring the parts installed and improving the notes taken by engineers during their visits to identify the causes of breakdowns, we will continue to lack the necessary data collection to enhance our service offering. 





Effects things have on other are sometimes indirect. Let's take an example
involving a soccer ball and a broken glass. Sometimes, you will break a glass by
shooting the ball right onto it. But sometimes not. Sometimes, the ball will
land next to a cat, a cat peacefully sleeping on someone's lap. Sometimes, the 
cat will end up scared which will result in a jump right onto a table, table 
on which was the glass[^1]. Indirect.
