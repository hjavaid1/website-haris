**Mediation analysis** is a statistical tool that can be use to find out that 
the reason why people are less likely to buy drugs with complex name is because 
they percieved the drugs as more dangerous. While there are several ways to
conduct mediation analysis, the `JSmediation` package implements the best one
of them[^3]: joint-significance.

Have a look at [the documentation](https://jsmediation.cedricbatailler.me/) and 
give it a shot!
