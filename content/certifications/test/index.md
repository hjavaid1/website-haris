I succesfully put my Azure skills to the test and passed the Data Scientist Associate exam on Dec 2022. ([hermes6](https://github.com/HealthEconomicsHackathon/hermes6)) by compiling the [test scripts](https://github.com/HealthEconomicsHackathon/hermes6/tree/master/scripts).

I learned the power of working collaboratively with people from various specialities as the team had people who concentrated on the statistics, R and GitHub work flow.
