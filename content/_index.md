description: "Tl:dr 

I am a data scientist with a passion for philosophy who likes the write and make podcasts. I'm not exactly Shakespeare when it comes to writing, so that's why I've illicted ther help of ChatGPT in writing this introduction. Take a gander, have a read and listen to my podcast. Enjoy! and an instructor spcialized in psychology and statistics. I studied psychology at Université Grenoble Alpes and this is where I learnt how to use numbers (or so-called data science methods) to better understand human behavior. Right now, I am looking for new ways to put these skills at use. When I am not coding or teaching, I’m usually enjoying the amazing outdoors which we have in the Alps, be it by biking, climbing, or hiking."
