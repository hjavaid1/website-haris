** Boiler plate code makes use of RACI, makes use of Main code and makes use of gantt charts to aid with delivery and proper project documentation **

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I naively assumed the next 8 months would all go to plan ... it couldn't have been further from the truth. It wasn't that my DR wasn't hard-working, ambitious or intelligent in fact quite the opposite but rather I'd forgetten an important teaching:

> "Humans are as different on the inside as they are on the outside"

Behavioural pyscology teaches us many things about what drives and fundementally motivates human behaviours.  

sometimes people prefer to do things their own way. Our project changed and time became limited, but I still pushed my DR to meet the objectives. This approach only made things worse.

Lesson Learned: Having a plan is essential for success, but being able to adapt and have a backup plan is equally important. Flexibility and an open-minded approach to change can ensure that even when things don't go according to plan, the ultimate goal can still be achieved.



## The desire to be a people pleaser. A manager can be friendly but not a friend




## Quarterly and Annual performance reviews are nerve wracking

Allow your team members to be honest, to openly say what they feel and most importantly dom't judge them. As a manager, I remember 

> We are more honest with search engines than with our family



To set that up, the only thing one has to do to get the green check mark is to
reference a ressource that has a link back to their Mastodon profile. Be
careful, this link MUST have
[a `rel="me"` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/me).
That is, when I wanted to get a green mark next to my website on
[my Mastodon account](https://fosstodon.org/@cedricbatailler), all I had to do
is to write the following:

    <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@cedricbatailler">Mastodon</a>

So, if you like lists:
1. On your website, **put a link to your Mastodon profile** (the link must
have a `rel=me` attribute)
2. Go to **your Mastodon profile**, click **Edit profile**, and, in the
**Profile metadata** section, **add a link to the resource where you put a
link to your Mastodon profile**
3. Profit?

## Humans are not code, you find this out quite quickly ...

You need to manage people as they want to be managed.

In a way, it is closer to a public mail verification (with a website instead
of mail) than the blue badge, but it if you believe that a verification
process should be a security feature, it gets the job done. **By taking 5 minutes
to set that up, you seriously limit the risk of impersonation**. This is
especially relevant on a website that allows anyone to open an account with
the same username as yours on any instance. **Do it**.
