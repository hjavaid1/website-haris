Here are 12 quotes from Charlie Munger that have influenced me the most:


### ** 1) "I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do."**

Charlie Munger emphasizes the importance of understanding both sides of an argument before forming an opinion. He believes that doing so can help avoid biases, prejudices, and misinformation, and make more objective decisions. It also promotes open-mindedness, which is essential in making informed choices.

### ** 2) "The first rule is that you’ve got to have multiple models – because if you just have one or two that you’re using, the nature of human psychology is such that you’ll torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least you’ll think it does."**

This quote highlights the need to have multiple perspectives when trying to understand complex issues. Charlie Munger suggests that relying on a single model can lead to a distorted view of reality, and one must be open to various approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a situation.

### ** 3) "You must force yourself to consider opposing arguments. Especially when they challenge your best-loved ideas."***
Charlie Munger advocates for considering opposing arguments, even if they challenge our deeply held beliefs. He believes that doing so can help broaden our perspective and prevent us from making flawed decisions. This approach requires intellectual honesty, courage, and an open mind to consider alternative viewpoints.

### ** 4)"Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts."***
Charlie Munger suggests that we should continuously strive to improve ourselves every day by gaining knowledge, learning new skills, and taking on new challenges. He believes that consistency and dedication to our goals, even in small increments, can lead to significant progress over time.

### ** 5)"If you’re capable of being open-minded, a lot of different people can be right in different ways and for different reasons."***
Charlie Munger believes that being open-minded is crucial in understanding different perspectives and approaches. He suggests that various people can be correct in different ways, and acknowledging this can help foster a more collaborative and productive environment.

### ** 6)"The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more."***
Charlie Munger advocates for the importance of education and sharing knowledge to benefit others. He believes that sharing knowledge and helping others learn can lead to a better society and improve the world.

### ** 7)"The wise man gets more benefit from his enemies than the fool from his friends."**
Charlie Munger suggests that one can learn more from their opponents than their allies. He believes that engaging in constructive debate and considering opposing viewpoints can lead to a deeper understanding of an issue.

### ** 8)"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."**
Charlie Munger highlights the importance of avoiding mistakes rather than attempting to be highly intelligent. He suggests that avoiding stupidity and errors can lead to significant long-term advantages.

### ** 9)"Spend less time trying to be brilliant and more time trying to avoid obvious stupidity."**
Charlie Munger advocates for the importance of avoiding common mistakes and foolish decisions. He suggests that this approach can lead to more significant progress than attempting to be highly intelligent.

### ** 10)"The best armor of old age is a well-spent life beforehand."***
This quote means that the best way to prepare for old age is to live your life in a meaningful and fulfilling way. Munger is suggesting that if you use your time wisely and make good choices throughout your life, you will have a better chance of being happy and fulfilled in your later years. The quote emphasizes the importance of living a purposeful life and investing in your own personal growth and development.

### ** 11)"You’re not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. You’re going to advance in life by what you’re going to learn after you leave here."***

He argues that our success in life will depend not only on what we already know but also on our willingness to learn and adapt to new situations. The quote highlights the importance of having a growth mindset and being open to new experiences and ideas.

### ** 12)"We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the esoteric. It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."***
This quote suggests that people often overlook the obvious in search of more complex and sophisticated solutions. Munger argues that the most successful people are those who focus on the basics and consistently make smart, simple decisions. He believes that by avoiding obvious mistakes and sticking to sound principles, we can achieve more success than by trying to be overly clever or complex. The quote emphasizes the importance of simplicity and common sense in achieving long-term success.
