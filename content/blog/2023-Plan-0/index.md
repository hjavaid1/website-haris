### Drawing the Map to Your Destination

>   **“Foresight is not about predicting the future, it’s about minimizing surprise.”** - Karl Schroeder

If there is anything 5 years of applied data science has taught me, it's so important to have a clear understanding of the destination you're aiming for. Just like planning a trip, this involves drawing a map that outlines the steps needed to get there. In the context of a Data Science project, this means defining your goals and outlining the key steps needed to achieve them.

- What's your Why?

> **“Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”** - Peter Drucker

It's so easy to jump straight into weeds - discussing the models, getting started with the EDA - without ever asking "Why?".
 - What is the problem you are trying to solve?
 - Is it even worth solving/solvable?
 - Why are we trying to solve it?

The data science solution could potentially impact only a small group of customers and have limited long-term potential. Perhaps the ask isn't even a problem or not significant enough to solve. It's crucial to take a step back and reflect on the project's purpose and rationale. Your plan should define clear goals for your project and break them into actionable steps. This can then be followed up with a one-page overview to communicate the steps and milestones to stakeholders and team members. Be sure to also identify potential roadblocks (e.g. data quality issues, technical constraints) and plan proactively for them to avoid project derailment.

### Choose the approach wisely

- Working Backwards 

According the "Working Backwards" authors Colin Bryar and Bill Carr, "in a working-backwards world, starting with the customer and working backwards is the only way to build products and services that customers actually want." The approach is centered around the customer's needs and incorporates sentiments of testing and validation during the development process. As Bryar and Carr explain, "The sooner you can validate an assumption, the sooner you can move on to the next assumption or pivot your approach."

This is also emphasised by Peter Drucker in his writing:

> "The purpose of a business is to create a customer. The test of the organisation is its capacity to create customers."

"Build It And They Will Come" is an approach where the team develops the solution with the assumption that there is a demand for it. This approach is useful when there is a high level of certainty that the solution will be useful to customers, and there is no need for further validation.
The "Build It And They Will Come" approach assumes that there is a demand for the product or service, but this is not always the case

### What will you deliver?

- Defining the Outcome (What)

Define success by specifying the desired outcome in quantifiable terms. This prevents chasing a moving target and helps decide which projects to pursue. Measuring success through business metrics such as conversion or savings from fraud reduction is crucial.

> ***“If you can’t measure it, you can’t change it.”*** - Peter Drucker

Limited resources (e.g. time, money, external support) require prioritisation, so it is critical to choose to invest in something more worthwhile instead of pursuing a problem that requires high accuracy.

- Creating a Deliverable: How to Proceed?

To achieve our desired outcomes, we must design a deliverable that meets our intentions and integrates with our current system. For example, an e-commerce platform may seek to improve product discovery and purchase experiences. We can choose to enhance search, recommendations, or email campaigns. If we opt for recommendations, we need to decide on the deployment method, such as using a daily updating cache or a service that accepts input and returns recommendations.

While a detailed plan is unnecessary, we should sketch out the basics to get buy-in from our business, product, and tech teams. 

> It's crucial to receive feedback on this plan to avoid creating a feature-rich deliverable that doesn't deliver results or can't be integrated. 

Avoid developing an overly complex recommender, for instance, if it cannot be integrated into the system.

### Constraints vs. Boundaries

One of the most important considerations in any Data Science project is the distinction between constraints and boundaries. While constraints refer to limitations imposed by the available data, resources, and time, boundaries refer to ethical and moral considerations that guide your approach and decision-making.

**Constraints** - such as limited data availability, computing resources, or time constraints. It's important to be realistic about these constraints and to adjust your approach accordingly. This may involve prioritizing certain data sources or analysis techniques, or finding creative solutions to work within your constraints.

**Boundaries** - refer to ethical and moral considerations that guide your approach and decision-making. This could include considerations around data privacy, bias and fairness, and transparency in your analysis and decision-making. 

{{< figure src="img/boundaries-vs-constraints.jpg" caption="Avoid the constraints, stay within boundaries" >}}

**Growth mindset** - Don't let the concept of boundaries restrict your mindset! When defining boundaries, ensure that you're approaching your project with a growth mindset, rather than a fixed mindset. A growth mindset involves a willingness to learn and adapt based on feedback and new information, while a fixed mindset can lead to rigid and inflexible approaches that are often ineffective.

Finally, it's important to consider the broader societal impacts of your project and to ensure that your approach is aligned with your values and goals. This may involve engaging with stakeholders and experts in your field to gain a deeper understanding of the potential impacts of your work, as well as considering the potential unintended consequences of your approach.

Part 4: Karl Schroeder's "Steering the Future"

Karl Schroeder's book "Steering the Future" provides valuable insights into the process of planning and executing successful projects. One of the key insights from the book is the importance of working backwards from your goals to determine the steps needed to achieve them.

Schroeder describes this approach as "backcasting", where you start with a clear vision of your desired end state and work backwards to determine the steps needed to get there. This approach can be particularly valuable in Data Science projects, where the complexity of the data and analysis can make it difficult to determine the most effective path forward.

To use backcasting effectively, it's important to start with a clear understanding of your project goals and the outcomes you hope to achieve. This may involve engaging with stakeholders and experts in your field to gain a deeper understanding of the problem you're trying to solve and the potential impact of your work.

Once you have a clear understanding of your goals, you can begin to work backwards to determine the steps needed to achieve them. This may involve breaking your project down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and identifying the dependencies and milestones that will enable you to move forward.

Another important insight from Schroeder's book is the importance of taking a systems thinking approach to your project. This involves looking beyond the immediate problem you're trying to solve and considering the broader context in which your project exists.

By taking a systems thinking approach, you can identify potential risks and opportunities that may impact your project, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks and capitalize on these opportunities.

Part 5: Parkinson's Law and the Importance of Constraints

Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. In the context of Data Science projects, this means that without clear constraints and deadlines, projects can easily become bloated and never reach completion.

To avoid this trap, it's important to set clear constraints and deadlines for your project. This may involve defining a clear scope and timeline for your project, and identifying key milestones and deliverables that need to be completed within specific timeframes.

In addition to setting constraints and deadlines, it's important to embrace the idea of working with limited resources. This may involve using existing data and tools rather than building everything from scratch, or focusing your analysis on a specific subset of data rather than trying to analyze everything at once.

By embracing constraints, you can encourage creativity and innovation, and ensure that your project stays focused on the most important goals and outcomes.

Another important aspect of working with constraints is the need to balance them with flexibility. While constraints are important for keeping your project on track, it's also important to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and new information.

By embracing both constraints and flexibility, you can create a framework for your Data Science project that encourages innovation and creativity while still ensuring that your project stays on track and delivers the outcomes you're looking for.

Part 6: Communication and Collaboration

Effective communication and collaboration are essential for the success of any Data Science project. This involves not only communicating clearly with your team members and stakeholders, but also being able to effectively communicate your findings and insights to non-technical audiences.

To facilitate communication and collaboration, it's important to establish clear roles and responsibilities within your team, and to establish regular check-ins and meetings to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

It's also important to be transparent about your process and methods, and to share your findings and insights with stakeholders throughout the project. This can help to build trust and credibility, and can ensure that your project is aligned with the needs and goals of your organization.

In addition to communication and collaboration within your team, it's also important to establish connections with other Data Science professionals and organizations. This can involve attending conferences and meetups, participating in online communities and forums, and collaborating on open source projects.

By establishing connections with others in the field, you can learn from their experiences and insights, and can gain access to valuable resources and tools that can help to drive the success of your project.

In conclusion, effective communication and collaboration are essential for the success of any Data Science project. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities, maintaining regular check-ins and meetings, being transparent about your process and methods, and building connections with other professionals and organizations, you can create a framework for your project that encourages innovation, creativity, and success.

Part 7: Reflection and Continuous Improvement

Reflection and continuous improvement are key to ensuring that your Data Science project is a success. This involves taking the time to reflect on your process and outcomes, and identifying areas for improvement and optimization.

One important aspect of reflection and continuous improvement is tracking your progress and measuring your success. This may involve setting clear metrics and KPIs for your project, and regularly evaluating your progress towards these goals.

It's also important to reflect on your process and methods, and to identify areas where you could streamline or optimize your workflow. This may involve using new tools or technologies, adopting new methodologies or frameworks, or simply making small adjustments to your existing process.

In addition to reflecting on your own process, it's also important to seek feedback and input from others. This may involve soliciting feedback from your team members, stakeholders, or other Data Science professionals, and using this feedback to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

By embracing a culture of reflection and continuous improvement, you can create a framework for your Data Science project that encourages innovation, creativity, and success. By regularly evaluating your progress and identifying areas for improvement, you can ensure that your project stays on track and delivers the outcomes you're looking for.


Part 8: Ethics, Privacy and Responsible Data Science

Ethics and responsible Data Science are critical considerations for any Data Science project. As Data Scientists, we have a responsibility to ensure that our work is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, and that we are not causing harm to individuals or society as a whole.

One important aspect of responsible Data Science is ensuring that your data is collected and used in an ethical and responsible manner. This may involve obtaining informed consent from individuals whose data you are collecting, and ensuring that you are using the data for the purposes for which it was collected.

It's also important to consider the potential impact of your work on individuals and society as a whole. This may involve conducting a thorough risk assessment of your project, and taking steps to mitigate any potential harms that may arise.

In addition to these considerations, it's important to be transparent about your work and methods, and to ensure that your findings and insights are presented in an unbiased and objective manner. This can help to build trust and credibility, and can ensure that your work is aligned with the values and principles of your organization.

Ultimately, by embracing ethics and responsible Data Science, you can ensure that your project has a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole, and that your work is conducted in a manner that is consistent with your values and principles.
